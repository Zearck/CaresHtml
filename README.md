# CaresHtml

This site is intended to complement the "CaresApp" application 
that aims to help the meeting between Caregivers and Convalescents.

CaresHTML" is intended to complement the "Settings" function of the 
Cares App, thus providing help in the bug reporting part of the application 
through the bottom of the page.
